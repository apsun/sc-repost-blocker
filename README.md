# SoundCloud repost blocker

Removes reposts from your SoundCloud stream. I follow artists because I
enjoy their music, not their taste in music.

Note that reposts on artist pages are not removed, since SoundCloud
has that functionality built in. Only reposts on the homepage stream
will be filtered.

## Notes

As of version 2.0, you may still see reposts if you are following the
artist who originally posted the track. This addresses the following
scenario: you follow both A and B; A posts a track; B reposts it.

As of version 2.1, you may still see reposts if the name of the user
reposting the track appears in the track title. This addresses the
following scenario: you follow A; B posts a track which A contributed to;
A reposts it (this is a common pattern for labels and collabs).
